<h1>About the school</h1>
<p>The Gateway Schools, New York (USA), was founded in 1965, by a parent and an educator. Together, they laid a foundation of optimism and child-centeredness in this institution that has been making a remarkable difference in the lives of children with learning disabilities and their families for over 45 years. In an attempt to extend the benefits of its powerful educational philosophy and innovative methods to children beyond the U.S., the Gateway School of New York has now partnered with The Keshavlal V. Bodani Education Foundation to establish The Gateway School of Mumbai. The vision behind this collaboration is to generate learning and spread evidence-based practices, in the field of education and therapies, in India and globally.

  The Gateway School of Mumbai is dedicated to empowering children with learning challenges - along with their families and the professionals that support them. Our intention is to help students develop the skills, knowledge, understandings and attitudes necessary for them to lead fulfilling and productive lives â€“ as independent and successful individuals that actively contribute to society.</p>
